Food Price Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Analysis Using ARIMA Model (Time Series)
Exploratory Analysis:
After cleaning and filtering the dataset using Power Query, I performed an exploratory analysis to extract relevant information such as:
1. Total missing values
2. Number of countries
3. First six rows
4. Display row and column
5. Measures of normality
6. Box plot to check outliers
7. Sorted top 10 and bottom 20 products.

Time Series Analysis:
I focused on predicting the prices of maize and bread in Nigeria for the next five years, using the best fit of the ARIMA model. However, the RMSE of 45.23, MAE of 34.7, and MAPE of 18.6 indicate that the model's fit is not satisfactory for predicting the regularity in future prices of these products.

Recommendations:
1. The model needs adjustment, such as considering a different model or number of periods.
2. Increasing the sample size by adding more data to improve the forecast's accuracy.
3. Regularly evaluating the forecast's accuracy and adjusting the model or data as needed to improve the accuracy.
